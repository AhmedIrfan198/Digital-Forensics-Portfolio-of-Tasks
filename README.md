# Digital Forensics and eDiscovery Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Digital Forensics and eDiscovery Portfolio. This project was a comprehensive university assignment designed to simulate real-world digital forensic scenarios and environments. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in various forensic tools and methodologies, showcasing my ability to handle forensic imaging, evidence collection, and analysis effectively.

The project involved creating and analyzing forensic images, conducting simulated evidence searches and seizures, and writing expert witness statements. These tasks were performed using industry-standard tools and techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability in the forensic process.

I am proud to share that my efforts in this project were rewarded with a final grade of 75%, reflecting my strong understanding and execution of digital forensic principles. This portfolio serves as a testament to my skills and dedication to the field of digital forensics and eDiscovery.

## Objective

The Digital Forensics and eDiscovery Portfolio aimed to demonstrate comprehensive skills in digital forensics and eDiscovery through a series of projects. These projects included imaging exercises, simulated evidence search and seizure, and written evidence analysis. The primary focus was to showcase proficiency in forensic tools, methodologies, and reporting techniques to potential recruiters.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of forensic imaging and verification.
- Proficiency in evidence collection, documentation, and analysis.
- Ability to conduct dual tool verification for forensic accuracy.
- Enhanced knowledge of search and seizure protocols in digital environments.
- Development of expert witness statement writing and courtroom presentation skills.

### Tools Used

- FTK Imager and FTK Forensic Toolkit for creating and analyzing forensic images.
- HashMyFiles for verifying image file hashes.
- Autopsy for evidence gathering and analysis.

## Steps

### Part A: Imaging Exercise

1. **Verify Forensic Image**:
    - Used HashMyFiles to verify the hash of the assigned image file.
    - This step ensured the integrity of the image file before proceeding with further analysis.

2. **Create EWF/E01 Image with Compression**:
    - Used FTK Imager to create a single compressed EWF/E01 image file.
    - This step demonstrated the ability to create forensic images with maximum compression to save storage space.

3. **Create Split EWF/E01 Image**:
    - Created an EWF/E01 image split into multiple parts using FTK Imager.
    - This step involved creating a split image file to demonstrate the ability to handle large forensic images effectively.

### Part B: Dual Tool Verification

1. **Verification with FTK Imager**:
    - Verified the integrity of the EWF/E01 image using FTK Imager.
    - This step involved using FTK Imager to ensure that the image file was created correctly and was verifiable.

2. **Verification with a Second Tool**:
    - Used another forensic tool to perform dual tool verification.
    - This step demonstrated the use of a secondary tool to verify the integrity of the image file, adhering to standard forensic practices.

### Part C: Search and Seizure

1. **Scene Setup**:
    - Set up a simulated environment with digital and non-digital artifacts.
    - This step involved creating a realistic search environment to simulate the conditions of a real-world forensic investigation.

2. **Search and Documentation**:
    - Conducted a search, documented evidence, and created an Exhibits Record table.
    - This step involved methodically searching the simulated environment, documenting the evidence found, and recording it in a detailed Exhibits Record table.

### Written Evidence and Opinion

1. **Analysis and Reporting**:
    - Analyzed the provided image file and answered specific forensic questions.
    - Produced an MG11-style expert witness statement.
    - This step involved conducting a detailed forensic analysis of the image file, answering specific questions posed by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), and producing a formal expert witness statement in accordance with legal standards.
